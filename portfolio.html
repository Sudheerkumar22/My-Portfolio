            <h1><center><u>ABOUT ME</u></center></h1>
            <p><center>Hello! I’m Adapa Naga Sudheer Kumar, a fresher passionate about learning and solving real-world problems through technology.Currently pursuing M.Tech in Computer Science (AI) at KIET College, I have gained valuable knowledge through academic projects and internships.

                <br>During my AICTE Internship with Microsoft and SAP, I developed a Potato Leaf Disease Prediction System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), marking my first step into the world of AI. Additionally, I’ve worked on projects like Company Connect, which helps students explore companies visiting their college for recruitment, and Prediction of Disease Outbreaks, where I built a Machine Learning-based system to predict health conditions like diabetes and heart disease.
                
                As a fresher, I am excited to apply my academic learnings and contribute to meaningful projects in a dynamic work environment.</center></p>

            <h1><center><u>INTERNSHIP</u></center></h1>
            <p><center>
                I successfully completed an AICTE Internship on Artificial Intelligence offered by Microsoft and SAP in January 2025. As part of this internship, I developed a Potato Leaf Disease Prediction System, a web-based application designed to identify and classify potato plant diseases such as Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The system enables users to upload leaf images and receive real-time disease predictions, providing an efficient tool for early disease detection in agriculture. This project allowed me to enhance my practical knowledge of AI and deep learning while applying my skills in model development and web deployment.

            <h3><u>COMPANY CONNECT</u></h3>
            <p><center>
                I developed Company Connect, a web-based platform designed to help students explore companies visiting their college for recruitment. This system provides valuable insights into companies that have conducted placement drives in previous years, allowing students to prepare better for opportunities. The platform enhances transparency in campus placements and serves as a useful resource for students seeking career guidance.
            </center></p>
            <h3><u>Prediction of Disease Outbreaks</u></h3>
            <p><center>
                I worked on a Machine Learning-based Disease Prediction System that diagnoses Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease using historical health data. The system employs Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to predict disease likelihood based on user-provided inputs. Additionally, I implemented an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the model and receive real-time predictions. This project aimed to demonstrate the potential of AI in early disease detection and healthcare applications.
